<p><strong>1. Your relationship with AG</strong></p>
<p>1.1 Your use of AG’s products, software, services and websites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by AG under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and AG. “AG” means Angry Group, Ltd., whose principal place of business is at [cAdddress]. This document explains how the agreement is made up and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.</p>
<p>1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with AG, your agreement with AG will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.</p>
<p>1.3 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and AG in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.</p>
<p>1.4 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</p>

<p>(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by AG in the user interface for any Service; or</p>

<p><strong>3. Language of the Terms</strong></p>

<p>19.4 You agree that if AG does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy that is contained in the Terms (or which AG has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of AG’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to AG.</p>
<p>19.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>

Other than this, no other person or company shall be third-party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
<p>19.7 The Terms and your relationship with AG under the Terms shall be governed by the laws of HONG KONG SAR, without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions. You and AG agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the country of HONG KONG SAR to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that AG shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
